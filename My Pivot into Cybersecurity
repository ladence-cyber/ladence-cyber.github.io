Before I committed to pivoting into the cybersecurity field, I was hesitant because I did not know how to write a single line of code. I still don't know, at the time of writing this. However, I came across the Google Cybersecurity Specialization that told me I didn't need to know how to code to get started in the field.

So, I started the first-week trial with the hope of dropping it once I got bored.

But I didn't get bored. I subscribed to the course after the first week, and three weeks later, I somewhat feel like a new person with lots of new knowledge, with enthusiasm to learn so many more things.

The first week's lessons were a breeze into the world of cybersecurity, and I learned a lot, mostly overviews of the courses to come. The stand-out for the course was learning and applying ethical concepts that guide cybersecurity professionals. I got to test my knowledge with some practical scenarios and tested my knowledge through practice assignments and plug-ins.

In the end, I passed the course with a grade of 99%%.
